                    <p>Adam's Peak is a holy and spiritual place in the heart of Sri Lanka. All religions appear to come together on this mountain: Christians and Muslims think here is where Adam made his first step on earth while Buddhists believe that was Buddha's first foot print and Hindus believe Shiva took his first step on earth via this peak.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Sama Chatiya at Adam's Peak</li>
                        <p>The Sama Chatiya, or World Peace Pagoda, may be found on the way up after a short climb.</p>
                        <p>In 1976, the eminent Japanese Buddhist monk Ven Nichi Fuji erected this stupa and still it is maintained by a group of Japanese monks. Though the stupa and environment were not visible during the night ascent, the Peace Pagoda shines out dramatically during the day with Adam's Peak as a backdrop.</p>
                        <li>Majestic Sunrise and the Shadow of the Mount</li>
                        <p>As the sun begins to rise, pilgrims and visitors flock to the eastern side to watch an incredible sight. The sun nearly leaps over the eastern horizon, casting a beautiful triangle of mountain shadow on the mountain's western backdrop. As the sun rises higher in the sky, the shadow moves closer to the mountain's base until it vanishes completely, capping off a beautiful natural display.</p>
